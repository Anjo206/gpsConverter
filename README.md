gpsConverter
============

So what this program does is that it takes in an a locations.txt or you can even use the subtitles file, 
the .srt file provided by AutoGuard and just change the file to a .txt file in notepad, and outputs the usable
gps file needed by GPSVisualizer on the web.


In short, it converts the .srt file to a gps file used on commonly on the web.
